# Welcome to My Blog!

I'm excited to launch my new blog using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. This is my first blog post!

## What to Expect

On this blog, I'll be sharing:

- Technical tutorials and guides
- Project updates and ideas
- Thoughts on software development
- And much more!

## How to Create New Posts

To create a new blog post, simply add a new markdown file to the `_posts` folder with the filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`

The front matter (the section between the `---` lines) contains important metadata about your post, such as the layout, title, date, and categories.

I hope you enjoy reading my blog. Feel free to check back often for new content!

Happy reading!
